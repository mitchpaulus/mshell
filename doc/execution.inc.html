<p>
Execution of external commands or binaries is different in <code>mshell</code>. Instead of it being the main syntactical construct, in <code>mshell</code> you build up a list of arguments, and then at a time of your choosing, you execute it.
For example:
</p>

<pre>
<code><span class="mshellLEFT_SQUARE_BRACKET">[</span><span class="mshellSINGLEQUOTESTRING">&#39;my-program&#39;</span> <span class="mshellSINGLEQUOTESTRING">&#39;arg1&#39;</span> <span class="mshellSINGLEQUOTESTRING">&#39;arg2&#39;</span><span class="mshellRIGHT_SQUARE_BRACKET">]</span><span class="mshellEXECUTE">;</span>
<span class="mshellEOF"></span></code>
</pre>

<p>
Often there are different things you want out of your execution,
or you want different behavior depending on the exit code.
<code>mshell</code> gives you full flexibility to decide with concise syntax.
</p>

<p>
To initiate execution, you use one of 3 operators:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>;</code>: Execute command, always continue. Don't provide any information on the exit code.</li>
  <li><code>!</code>: Execute command, but stop the running script execution on any non-zero exit code.</li>
  <li><code>?</code>: Execute command, leaving the exit code integer on the stack.</li>
</ul>

<pre>
<code><span class="mshellLEFT_SQUARE_BRACKET">[</span><span class="mshellSINGLEQUOTESTRING">&#39;false&#39;</span><span class="mshellRIGHT_SQUARE_BRACKET">]</span><span class="mshellEXECUTE">;</span> <span class="mshellLINECOMMENT"># mshell will continue past this point</span>
<span class="mshellLEFT_SQUARE_BRACKET">[</span><span class="mshellSINGLEQUOTESTRING">&#39;true&#39;</span><span class="mshellRIGHT_SQUARE_BRACKET">]</span><span class="mshellBANG">!</span> <span class="mshellLINECOMMENT"># Will execute and continue because of 0 exit code</span>
<span class="mshellLEFT_SQUARE_BRACKET">[</span><span class="mshellSINGLEQUOTESTRING">&#39;my-command&#39;</span><span class="mshellRIGHT_SQUARE_BRACKET">]</span><span class="mshellQUESTION">?</span> <span class="mshellVARSTORE">exitCode!</span>
<span class="mshellFORMATSTRING">$&#34;Exit code was {@exitCode}&#34;</span> <span class="mshellLITERAL">wl</span>
<span class="mshellEOF"></span></code>
</pre>

<p> 
The other choice you often have when executing commands is what to do with the standard output.
Sometimes you will want to redirect it to a file, other times you will want to leave the contents on the stack to process further.
For that, you use the <code>></code> and <code>*</code> operators.
</p>

<pre>
<code><span class="mshellLEFT_SQUARE_BRACKET">[</span><span class="mshellLITERAL">yourCommand</span><span class="mshellRIGHT_SQUARE_BRACKET">]</span> <span class="mshellPATH">`fileToRedirectTo`</span> <span class="mshellGREATERTHAN">&gt;</span> <span class="mshellBANG">!</span> <span class="mshellLINECOMMENT"># Redirects the output to the file.</span>
<span class="mshellLEFT_SQUARE_BRACKET">[</span><span class="mshellLITERAL">yourCommand</span><span class="mshellRIGHT_SQUARE_BRACKET">]</span> <span class="mshellLITERAL">*</span> <span class="mshellGREATERTHAN">&gt;</span> <span class="mshellBANG">!</span> <span class="mshellLINECOMMENT"># Puts all of stdout on the stack as a string.</span>
<span class="mshellEOF"></span></code>
</pre>
