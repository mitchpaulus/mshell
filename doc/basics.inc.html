<p> <code>mshell</code> is, as the name suggests, a shell.
Shells are programs that are useful for executing external executables and writing small scripts to get common tasks done.</p>

<p>
Other players in this arena would be projects like:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>bash/sh</li>
  <li>zsh</li>
  <li>fish</li>
  <li>elvish</li>
  <li>oil</li>
  <li>Nushell</li>
</ul>

<p>
What's unique about <code>mshell</code> is that it is a <i>Concatenative, stack-based</i> programming language.
</p>

<p> 
The key property of a programming language like this is that there is an implicit stack of data being transformed throughout the entire execution. 
For example, to add two numbers, you push both arguments onto the stack and then <code>+</code> pops the top two arguments off the top and leaves the result.
</p>

<pre>
<code><span class="mshellINTEGER">1</span> <span class="mshellLINECOMMENT"># Push 1 on the stack [1]</span>
<span class="mshellINTEGER">2</span> <span class="mshellLINECOMMENT"># Push 2 on the stack [1 2]</span>
<span class="mshellPLUS">+</span> <span class="mshellLINECOMMENT"># Add them together [3]</span>
<span class="mshellEOF"></span></code>
</pre>
