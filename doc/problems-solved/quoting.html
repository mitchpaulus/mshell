<h1>Quoting</h1>

<p>
Anyone who has programmed in shell has to come to terms with quoting.
Quoting is pretty much required everywhere.
</p>

<p>
<code>mshell</code> does not have any concept of quoting.
There is no <i>expansion</i> phase of evaluation.
There is only forward evaluation of the code and updates to the stack environment.
Strings are just strings and they can be concatenated or modified via functions.
</p>

<p>
<code>mshell</code> also has string interpolation with the <code>$"{ }"</code> form.
</p>

<p>
This is literally example #1 of <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls#for_f_in_.24.28ls_.2A.mp3.29">Bash Pitfalls</a>.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
for f in $(ls *.mp3); do    # Wrong!
    some command $f         # Wrong!
done

for f in $(ls)              # Wrong!
for f in `ls`               # Wrong!

for f in $(find . -type f)  # Wrong!
for f in `find . -type f`   # Wrong!

files=($(find . -type f))   # Wrong!
for f in ${files[@]}        # Wrong!
</code>
</pre>

<p>
You can accomplish what you want in <code>mshell</code> like:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
[command *.mp3 glob];
</code>
</pre>

Other examples from <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls">Bash Pitfalls</a>
</p>

<pre>
<code>
cp $file $target
</code>
</pre>

<p>No problems here:</p>

<pre>
<code>
'my path with spaces.txt' file!
'~!@# $$ $%^^' target!
@file @target cp
</code>
</pre>
